title: Machine leraning or low frequency cryptocurrency data
---
In this project, I will analyze low frequency (5-10s) data from GDAX cryptocurrency exchange, and
see if I can come up with a profitable strategy using various machine learning techniques.  
This strategy is backtested in idealized condition (no market impact assumptions, no commission fees ecc...)
